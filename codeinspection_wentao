Bugs:
  - push_file will commit a pull request to github regardless if the file has been modified.
  - This causes github to receive an empty merge.
Suggestion for fix:
  - Check for changes prior to committing pull request.


Missing documentation:
  - Lacking docstring and comments for functions push_file and create_pull_request.
Suggestion for fix:
  - More comments.
  
  
Vulnerabilities in code:
  - Did not check for changes in files prior to push. This could make the merging process very time consuming.
  - Invalid parameters not handled.
Suggestion for fix:
  - Same as above.
