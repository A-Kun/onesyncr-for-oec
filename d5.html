    <h6><a id="Did_you_follow_your_plans_exactly_huh_or_did_you_have_to_replan_Why_and_when_0"></a>Did you follow your plan(s) exactly (huh!), or did you have to re-plan? Why and when?</h6>
    <p>Before we started coding, we analyzed all of the requirements given by the client and we wrote personas and user stories. During the first week of the project, we achieved the basic functionalities for checking the required databases and getting data
      from them. We wrote a crawler to crawl data and parse crawled data into dictionaries. We implemented an email sending function which connects to the email server, sends out emails and generates HTML email contents. We also worked on GitHub API to
      create a pull request to GitHub and pass the URL of the pull request to the email module. Throughout this sprint, we realized that some features are just nice to have, so we lowered the priority of comparing and showing differences between databases.
      For the next release, since we basically finished the backend, we re-planed to add a user interface into the release. We developed the user interface and also fixed some technical issues like the compare function. Starting from this deliverable,
      we focused on implementing merge without any bugs and making our front end API work efficiently. We made sure basic features like parsing data and merging from differently formatted data is working completely fine by doing code inspection. Then
      from there we developed more features like allowing the client to edit the file and also improved the user interface.</p>
    <h6><a id="What_was_your_estimated_project_velocity_How_did_it_change_with_each_deliverable_2"></a>What was your estimated project velocity? How did it change with each deliverable?</h6>
    <p>Overall, our project had a smooth transaction from deliverable 2 to deliverable 3. We put our user stories from deliverable 2 into our backlog and had an estimated project velocity of 60 story points (1 story point == 1 dev hour). We followed our
      plan and finished 39 story points in this sprint and moved the one user story that was not finished into the next sprint. For deliverable 4, the estimated velocity was 56 story points and the actual velocity was 36 story points. We moved two stories
      to the next. For the last deliverable, we finished all of the planned story points and discarded the lowest priority ones. The estimated velocity was 58 story points, and actual velocity was 51 points.</p>
    <h6><a id="How_does_the_work_done_for_deliverable_5_compare_to_the_work_on_all_previous_deliverables_both_in_terms_of_progress_and_end_result_4"></a>How does the work done for deliverable 5 compare to the work on all previous deliverables, both in terms of progress and end result?</h6>
    <p>As mentioned above, compared to all previous deliverables, deliverable 5 was more about code inspection (making sure everything works perfectly) and adding small features. We made good progress by quickly identifying and fixing issues in our project.
      It resulted in an end product that satisfies the basic requirements and works perfectly. We ended up discarding or simplifying some features that are non-essential, due to time constraints.</p>
    <h6><a id="Submit_an_updated_description_of_the_system_componets_what_they_are_what_their_responsibilities_are_and_what_are_the_interactions_betwwen_them_6"></a>Submit an updated description of the system componets: what they are, what their responsibilities are, and what are the interactions betwwen them.</h6>
    <p>The system use browser server structure, there are front end view which directly interact with user. Whenever a user sign in or click on the button, a request will send to server side. Then server take the request and operate business logic and render
      results to front end page view. The system binding all merge algorithm (A module named <code>main.py</code>) with a HTTP request within server side. All HTTP handler inside <code>service.py</code>. When look for a update, the system will download
      files from all databases into local file folder first, then <code>merge.py</code> will compare files to files within a different folders. Once the files are merged, ready to make push API call to Github.</p>
    <h6><a id="Describe_and_explain_any_changes_you_made_8"></a>Describe and explain any changes you made.</h6>
    <p>We thought about use third party Non-relational database to improve performce, However, after gave a try and we found it is too complicated to implement in such a way. First we need to compare data in dictionary, which make the comparation much harder.
      Secondly, we need to find a way to convert dictionary to xml and xml to dictionary. Therefore, we come back to original designed and use multithreading module to improve better performance.</p>

    <h6><a id="if_a_bug_how_to_reproduce_14"></a>(if a bug) how to reproduce</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>In <code>main.py</code>, we use the recursive call to any children, and set up cases for update. The bug might exists on the cases that we not yet test and cover in all scenarios. The merge function seems to be cause a bit issue while generating
        some empty tag. When data goes up very large, it is hard to find what cause the issue exactly. Also we found there are some bad data from NASA database while generating xmls. We suggest to come up with better algorithm to ignore the bad data instead
        actually convert to useless XMLs.</li>
