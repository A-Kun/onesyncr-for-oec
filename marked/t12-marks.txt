CSCC01 Deliverable 3 Marking Guide
-----------------------------------

Project Management:  __________ (40%) 33/40

  Release plan:  
    - each release corresponds to end of Sprint
    - project fully laid out:
      for each release date, list of user stories to implement
    - project velocity specified and used
    - highest priority user stories first modulo dependencies 
    - reasonable goals for each release [-1], a little over ambitious, completing merge in first sprint plus other things is a little unreasonable.

    [4/5]


  Product Backlog:
    - user stories follow the correct format.
    - user stories, together, reflect all the user requirements (from
      all personas).
    - user stories correspond to actual requirements (no "invented"
      features).
    - user stories contain enough information for devs to estimate how
      long it would take to implement it.
    - each user story addresses one specific requirement (no "world
      peace" stories).

    [5/5], Great job

  Sprint Backlog(s):
     - user stories taken from the Product Backlog
     - estimated costs
     - estimated values

     [3/5] Missing either costs / values, confusing

  Sprint Plan(s):
    - user stories divided into tasks when appropriate.
    - each Sprint Plan contains all the necessary information:
        who is working on which task on which day [-1]
    - sum of costs of user stories in the sprint = project velocity
    - good planning decisions [-1]

    [3/5] Decision seemed very ambitious but they were capable of delivering most of the user stories.

  Use of Task Board:
    - correct format of task boards
    - snapshots in the begginning and end of each Sprint are provided

    [5/5]
    
  Use of Burndown Charts:
    - snapshots in the begginning and end of each Sprint are provided
    - correctness of burndown charts

    [5/5]

  Use of Repo:
    (good use of branches not required here, but is required for next deliverable)

    [3/5] - Commits dominated by Wentao and A-Kun, I'd like to see more contribution from the others.

  Use of communication tools:
     - evidence of using communication tools of their choice effectively

    [5/5]


Design and Implementation:  __________ (30%) 22/30

   System Design:
      - good modular design
      - general and easy to extend
      - it is clear how the current implementation is going to be
        extended into an application that satisfies the client's needs

    [7/10] - File names should be more descriptive, overall very clear separation of concerns for each file. Would have gotten perfect if a diagram of sorts was shown.

   Implementation:
     - 0 marks if it doesn't run
     - at least one feature is either fully implemented of nearly implemented
     - quality and maturity of code


    -5, use of global 'SYSTEMS', not good.
    [15/20] Overall great start, good demo, shown solid progress.




Report: __________ (20%) 20/20

  - well-presented, is easy to read and to navigate 5/5
  - spelling and grammar 5/5, massive improvement, great job.
  - looks professional 
  - quality of the README file

  Good.
