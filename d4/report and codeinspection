Bugs:
  - push_file will commit a pull request to github regardless if the file has been modified.
  - This causes github to receive an empty merge.
Suggestion for fix:
  - Check for changes prior to committing pull request.


Missing documentation:
  - Lacking docstring and comments for functions push_file and create_pull_request.
Suggestion for fix:
  - More comments.
  
  
Vulnerabilities in code:
  - Did not check for changes in files prior to push. This could make the merging process very time consuming.
  - Invalid parameters not handled.
Suggestion for fix:
  - Same as above.
  
  
Summary:
As our project progressed from deliverable 3 to deliverable 4. 
We made a few changes in our original plan. We re-planed to add a user interface into the release. 
For deliverable 3 we worked on backend to satisfy the basic requirements. 
In deliverable 4, we focused more on the front end. We developed the user interface and also fixed with some technical issues like improving the compare function and merge function.  
We did the code inspection and fixed bugs. 
The estimated velocity was supposed to be 4 user stories, but because members had assignments and term tests to work on this week. We did not end up finishing GitHub accept and reject functions. 
The actual velocity is 2. We are moving theses unfinished functions to the next release.
